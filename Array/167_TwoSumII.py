167. Two Sum II - Input array is sorted

Given an array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.
Return the indices of the two numbers (1-indexed) as an integer array answer of size 2, where 1 <= answer[0] < answer[1] <= numbers.length.
The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.

Example 1:
Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.

Example 2:
Input: numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6
Output: [1,3]

        l, r = 0, len(numbers)-1
        while l < r:
            tempSum = numbers[l] + numbers[r]
            if target == tempSum:
                return [l+1, r+1]
            elif target < tempSum:
                r -= 1
            else:
                l += 1
